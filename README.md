Deployment: https://rachelhollister.github.io/unit-4-game/

Beep the Bop is a interactive game application that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library. Overall this application is in the theme of fun colored robots. Each time the player "Beeps" a "Bop" they will be adding a sum to reach the targeted number. The application flows as follows; the player is prompted to click on a robot, four robots are displayed as buttons on the page, the player will be shown a random number from 19-120, each robot has a hidden value of 1-12, once the player clicks on a robot a specific amount of points will be added to the total score. The player wins once their total score matches the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. Once the game begins again, the player will see a new random number populate, and the robots will have new values.
